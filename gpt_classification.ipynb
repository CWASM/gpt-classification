        "Introduction\n",
        "The goal of this task is to label information that is being shared on X (formerly Twitter) during severe winter weather events in Canada. We are focusing on the ways in which posts on X help provide situational awareness during severe winter weather events. We ask you to identify all of the relevant labels (defined below). None of these categories are mutually exclusive meaning that a post can belong to multiple categories and all relevant categories should be selected.\n",
        "Label Definitions\n",
        "-”Weather information”: Posts that contain weather information similar to what one could get from a weather channel or expect from a weather presenter on TV. This category has been left somewhat open-ended and tries to capture posts that are informative and precise enough to be useful for a person affected by a severe winter weather event.\n",
        "-”Caution”: Posts with the intent to inform the affected public about some risk-carrying situation that is directly or indirectly related to a specific weather event. The fact that the post was made with an obvious intent to caution people is a crucial criteria for this category.\n",
        "-”Advice”: Posts that provide information in the body of the post about how the reader can reduce the impact of a specific weather event on themselves or the community.\n",
        "-”Resources”: Posts that inform the reader about a resource(s) (e.g., website, different Twitter/X account, phone number) that people can leverage to improve their response to a specific weather event. Coders should err on the side of caution and only include posts when they are confident there is a leverageable resource.\n",
        "-”Service interruption”: Posts that inform people about weather event-caused interruptions to services such as road closures, public transit interruptions, power outages, closures of businesses, schools and other services. This includes: Notifications about the end of service interruptions, Notifications about services not closing, Self imposed/voluntary service interruptions when the request comes from the provider of the service (e.g., phone company asking people to limit their data usage), Reduced service, and Potential future interruptions\n",
        "-”Remediation”: Posts related to responses to a specific weather event which stop or reverse the damage of a specific weather event (e.g., snowplowing, opening shelters, volunteering). Many of these will be done by government officials but this category is applicable to actions taken by any person or group of people (e.g., neighbors, non-profit). Remediation can refer to actions taken in preparation for a weather event and normal clean up during or after an event.\n",
        "-“Casualty”: Posts related to negative human health impacts as a result of a severe weather event. This includes people dying, being injured, and mental health impacts. This is limited only to impacts that have occurred or are occurring (i.e. not possible future health impacts).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Label the posts on a four-point scale based on how certain you are that a category is applicable. The labels and their definitions are:\n",
        "-“0”: Definitely an irrelevant category\n",
        "-“1”: Probably an irrelevant category\n",
        "-“2”: Probably a relevant category\n",
        "-“3”: Definitely a relevant category\n",
